Approach: 

Used SQL and Python to implement logic designed to find customers at each touch point on the app

Evaluated the funnel health using SQL with visualizations with Python

Outcome:

Concluded that 50% drop rate is the highest at the screen where users have to enter their phone numbers to get registered
