# User-Conversion-Funnel-Analysis
Analyzed the conversion of users from one checkpoint to another within the registration page of an e-commerce startup app

Problem Statement: Evaluate an e-commerce startup app to determine which touchpoint causes most users to leave. Analyze the funnel health.

Approach: 
Used SQL and Python to implement logic designed to find customers at each touch point on the Toyota App
Evaluated the funnel health using SQL with visualizations with Python

Outcome:
Concluded that 50% drop rate is the highest at the screen where users have to enter their phone numbers to get registered
Alternate solution with easier user journey is to get registered via logged in email address
